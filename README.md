## Build setup

### For production

it's real easy. Just replace the environment variables with suitable value (see wiki)
and run:

`docker-compose -f prod.docker-compose.yml up --build`

Depending on your build system, things might be different, and a proxy is probably needed for a real production version of Gamma.

### Development

run

`docker-compose up --build` to build the frontend, database, databasemonitoring, and all microservices that's needed for Gamma.

then you will need to start the server, this is done by running the Java code in the backend, and is probably best done through an IDE.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is auto-generated by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and can be found under http://localhost:8081/api/swagger-ui.html while the application is running.
